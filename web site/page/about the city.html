       <p>The origin and further development of the city was determined by the industry formed on the basis of the manganese ore deposit in the Kvirili river valley. The foundation of the city was laid in 1879, when the mining of manganese ore began on the initiative of Akaki Tsereteli. Chiaturi Black Stone Mining Society was founded, which was engaged in manganese mining. In 1895, a railway was built that connected Chiaturi railway station to Shorapani. During this period, about 6 thousand people worked in Chiatura, and the share of manganese in the world export reached 50%. Built in the 19th century, only the right side of the Kvirili river was built, old Chiatura was known for its narrow streets, which arose spontaneously, without planning. <br> <br> In this part, the historical development and the network of streets have been preserved.
        In 1892, the English built the first tennis court in Chiatura, Georgia. The development of tennis in Georgia dates back to the 19th century.In Chiatura, the manager of the English firm "Forward and Salinas", John Tarsay, introduced a new game, lawn tennis, to Manganum city. The prominent English tennis player and teacher Ian Homer, who worked in Chiatura, mentions in his memoirs that the Tsereteli family and Akaki Tsereteli watched the tennis spectacle. From Chiaturi, tennis spread to Tbilisi and Batumi.
        Chiatura was declared a city in 1921.Since 1921, Chiathura has been celebrating the town's holiday "Chiaturuba", which is attended by fa
        mous Georgians and representatives of towns friendly with Chiathura. <br> <br> In 1924, an uprising against the Soviet regime began in almost all major cities of Georgia. On August 28, the uprising started in Chiatura as well. For 3 days, the Chiaturians were able to restrain the punitive squads sent from Tbilisi to suppress the rebellion, however, on the 4th day, the Georgian Tseka suppressed the rebellion and brutally attacked the people participating in the demonstrations, shooting up to 2000 ChiaturiansDuring the Soviet period, Chiatura was a republican subordinate city and the center of the Chiatura City Council. In 1954, the first passenger cableway in the USSR was built in Chiatura, between the city center and the industrial district of Perevis. The number of passenger ropeways in the surroundings of Chiaturi is more than two dozen, which is one of the highest indicators in the world[1]. The drawing up and construction of Chiaturi passenger suspension cableway projects were carried out by local engineers. Giorgi Fantsulaia was an outstanding specialist in this matter, with the project of which ropeways were built both in Chiatura and in other cities of Russia. In 1964, Chiatura was connected to Sachkhere by a trolleybus line. This was the first intercity trolleybus line in the Georgian SSR.

        <p>The legend of the origin of the city's name is very interesting. It is said that when a passenger, probably a Rachveli who went hunting in the mountains of Zemo Imereti, saw the silvery river roaring from the top of the mountain in the valley, he asked in surprise: "Is this a worm or what?" The legend is quite popular and has become so popular among the city's population that they even consider it to be true. Chiatura is also precious to the Georgian man because its establishment is connected with the name of our greatest poet Akaki Tsereteli, who was always loved by the public. Akaki Tsereteli's letters help us "Where today there is neither road nor tracks, the railway will come, this desert, Chiatura, will be cultivated."-- wrote Akaki Tsereteli, the great shepherd of Georgia.
        From Akaki's writings, we understand that even in his childhood he paid attention and deeply stuck in his memory the warning given by his father Rostom Tsereteli to Mouravi, that wheat grown on the lands of Tirskvali village should not be mixed with wheat taken from other places, otherwise we will die. The small grains of kvagundi mix and completely blacken the bread.
        After returning to his homeland (1863-1864), Akak specially went to the village of Tirskval and thoroughly inspected the places there. I was more surprised by the abundance of black stone. Immediately after seeing it, I thought that it was not just black stone, but that it must be manganese. I understood that tooHow do they use it in factories", Akaki showed the samples to the geologist Simonovich, adding, "I need your help."
        monovich explored manganese sites free of charge and together with Akaki compiled a brochure about the Chiaturi deposit, which he later published in Russian, French, German and English languages.
        It became known abroad that a large manganese deposit was discovered in the Caucasus. Many firms, for example, "Terre Noir" and others reacted negatively to the story of manganese in Georgia. They wrote that it would be easier to bring manganese ore from the moon than from the Caucasus, citing the inaccessibility of manganese ore sites as the reason.
        Despite this, Akaki did not get discouraged and continued the work he started with full faith and strength.
        The case failed, Akaki spent more than 10,000 tumans for developing the Chiaturi mine - it remained completely unreimbursed, especially since the ore already mined in the mine leased by him was also mined by someone else. Because of this, Akaki wrote in 1893: "I have only suds and processes left in my hands, which, of course, I am happy and excited about." Thirteen years, Mgosani continues, they made fun of me, interfered with me, they didn't believe in me... and when everything turned out to be true, they brushed it off as if it was nothing. There were those who laughed at Akaki unjustly. He reminded them of his achievements: "I sowed, harvested. I plucked, thinned, and when it was baked, others tore it out of my hand, but they themselves made it beautiful and held a candle to the cook."                                             
        After that, Akaki abandoned the business of processing manganese ore. He also had his own estates for this work, but he fulfilled his mission. Akaki became interested in Georgian and foreign capitalists

          <p>Chiaturi districts are connected to the central part of the city by cableways.
          The cableways here were opened in the Soviet period and are still working and are of great interest to tourists. It is believed that the first passenger aerial cableway in the Soviet Union was built in Chiatura in 1953. The ancient passenger-cableway called 25 is especially interesting, which is currently being better rehabilitated, although its authentic appearance will be fully preserved and it will be the only one. , which revives the Soviet period. Together with the industrial heritage, aerial cableways are the main factor determining the international recognition of Chiaturi. "In the landscape of the city, the volumes characteristic of the monumental "Stalinist" architecture of cable stations, plain and plastic forms characteristic of late Soviet modernism, high-rise metal constructions, monolithic forms treated with rough concrete characteristic of brutalist architecture can be read as accents. The well-developed aerial cableway system and the sophisticated and varied architectural appearance of the stations add special charm to the city and its one -It's one business card"

          <p>The main role in the economy of the municipality is played by industry, in particular, mining and enrichment of manganese ore. Manganese ore mining has a history of more than 130 years. Other useful minerals are also mined: marble and quartz sand. Quartz sand is used in various types of construction as concrete filler and plastering material. Brown marble, which is a precious paving material, is found in the village of Salieti.
          The Chiatura-Sachkhere-Gomi road of state importance passes through the territory of the municipality. The length of roads of local importance is 270 km
