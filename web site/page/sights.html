        <p>Katsakhi column - a limestone columnar denudation "witness" - a rock formed in the village of Katskhi, Chiaturi municipality, in the Imereti region, at the watershed of the rivers Katskhur (right tributary of Kvirili) and Khvitori (left tributary of Buji).
           The height of the column is 40 meters. Some researchers believe that the Katzakh pillar was originally the abode of Monophysite exiles, although this opinion is not universally shared, due to the lack of proper argumentation. On the upper platform of the column there are two small churches (today they remain in the form of ruins). The researchers connect the building of chapels in such places with Mesvety, which in the 6th century was widespread in Asia and, above all, in Syria, with which Christian Georgia had close relations. One church (V century) is dry-built with locally quarried, rough-hewn stone, the apse is carved into the rock. The second one (VI century) is built with well-hewn blocks pulled from below, has a crypt (lower floor — tomb). No one knows exactly when the religious life was stopped on the Katsakhi pillar, but during the time of Vakhushti Batonishvili, monks no longer worked here

      <p>Mghvimevi nunnery — a monastery in the gorge of the Kvirili river, near the village of Mghivemivi, Chiaturi municipality.
       It is easier to get to the monastery from Chiaturi. A narrow and rather long staircase leads from Chiaturi to the monastery, after passing through which it is possible to enter the tunnel. The tunnel is man-made, quite long, and its roof is supported by supporting arches.
       The monastery complex consists of many buildings. The main temple is named after the Savior. It is a two-nave basilica, the naves of which are separated from each other by arches resting on massive columns. The facade of the building is decorated with very rich carvings. Here you can find: carvings made around the window, monumental crosses, interlocking rhombuses, cornice carvings, etc. One of the attractions of the Cathedral of the Savior is the wooden kankel, which is completely painted. The door of Kankel is decorated with embossed plates, and in its upper part there is a composition of the Savior and twelve apostles, various episodes of his (the Savior's) life. In the temple, the wall frescoes are also preserved, including the portraits of the founder of this monastery in the 13th century, Rati Rachi Eristavi, his wife and brother, Niania Kakhaberisdze. Behind the central cathedral is the Mghvimevi cave, where services are held on major holidays.

        <p>History of tenni-
           In 1892, the English built the first tennis court in Chiatura, Georgia. The development of tennis in Georgia dates back to the 19th century. John Tarsey, manager of the English firm "Forward and Salinas" in Chiatura, introduced a new game, lawn tennis, to Manganum city. The prominent English tennis player and teacher Ian Homer, who worked in Chiatura, notes in his memoirs that the Tsereteli family and the immortal horseman himself - Akaki Tsereteli, watched the tennis spectacle. From Chiaturi, tennis spread to Tbilisi and Batumi</p>

        <p>Dzudzuana cave-is a cave of karst origin in Chiaturi municipality, Georgia. It is located in the territory of the village of Mgvimevi, on the right bank of Nekris, the right tributary of the Kvrili river, at an altitude of 515 m above sea level. It represents a multi-layered (from the Upper Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age) cave dweller. It was discovered in 1966 under the guidance of archaeologist Davit Tushabramishvili.
           The depth of Dzudzuana cave is 160 m, the width of the entrance is 22 m, the height is 10-15 m. The total length is 175 m. It became known to the world after an ancient, early Upper Paleolithic 34,000-year-old flax thread was found here, which is of world importance. 8 lithological layers with a total thickness of 3.5 m were excavated. The lower layer turned out to be sterile, the next 4 layers contained classic samples of the Upper Paleolithic age. The material of the V-VII layers is made with archaic techniques and is close to the Upper Paleolithic monuments of Western Georgia. Remains of late Pleistocene fauna were also found, including: brown bear, cave bear, bison, wild horse, deer and others. The top 3 layers contained Eneolithic-Early Bronze Age material.
           In 1966-75, archaeologist Davit Tushabramishvili conducted research in Dzudzuana cave. At this time, a zero line was passed in the cave and 1 X 1 m squares were planned, two exploration trenches were made. No. 1 (inside the cave) and No. 2 (at the entrance to the cave), through which it was possible to determine the stratigraphy of the cave. The following cultural layers were confirmed: I of the Eneolithic-Early Bronze Age and II of the Upper Paleolithic period. Cultural layer I was excavated in A-I 18–18. in quadrats where the layer thickness varied from 0.60 m to 1.0 m.
           A new stage in the study of Zudzuana began in 1983 under the leadership of Tengiz Meshvelian, who tried to check the previously available data and reviewed the Upper Paleolithic culture of Zudzuana and Georgia in general. Geological and palynological studies were conducted in the cave in 1987-89</p>

The fort is built on a rock raised on a steep slope. There are caves on the northern slope. The entrance is from the east. There are three levels of construction in the walls of the castle: 1. The early medieval level is built with half-smoothed small squares, with horizontal piles of rows, 2. The advanced medieval level is built with large smoothed squares, 3. The late medieval level is built with a mixture of cobblestone and flat stones. Vakhushti Bagrationi named the date of its construction as the 30s of the 8th century, the age of Murvan Kru's campaign in Georgia.
